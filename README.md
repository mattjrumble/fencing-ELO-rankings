# Fencing ELO rankings

The aim is to apply an ELO ranking system to British Fencing results to get a more accurate indicator of true strength than the official rankings (which are designed more to encourage participation than to truly reflect the strength of the fencers).

# Process

1.  Get all the competition info from the following pages:

        https://www.britishfencing.com/results-rankings/2016-2017-event-results-archive/
        https://www.britishfencing.com/results-rankings/2017-18-event-results-archives/
    
    Manually convert the info on the pages into a consistent format with competition name, weapon, date, download link, and any extra info.
