# Fencing ELO rankings

The aim is to apply an ELO ranking system to British Fencing results to get a more accurate indicator of true strength than the official rankings, which are designed more to encourage participation than to truly reflect the strength of the fencers.

When I started this, British Fencing had removed all their online results from before 2018, with only nicely formatted results of the last year, so I gave up on this since there wouldn't be enough data.

Since then, a more complete set of results have been put back up at https://www.britishfencing.com/results-rankings/2017-18-event-results-archives/ and https://www.britishfencing.com/2016-2017-event-results-archive/. They're in a hodgepodge of different formats, but I think there's enough data to do something with now. Maybe in the future they'll upload even older ones too. And if I can get all the older results in a consistent format, they might be interested in that themselves.
